In the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern, the **business logic** should be placed in the **Model** component. Let's break it down:

1. **Model**:
   - The **Model** represents the **data** and **business logic** of the application.
   - It directly manages the data (such as database interactions) and contains the rules and operations related to the application's core functionality.
   - Business logic includes tasks like validation, calculations, data transformations, and interactions with external services.
   - For example, if you're building an e-commerce application, the Model would handle tasks like processing orders, calculating prices, and managing inventory.

2. **Controller**:
   - The **Controller** is responsible for handling user input and managing the flow of data between the Model and the View.
   - It receives requests from the user (e.g., via HTTP routes) and invokes the appropriate methods in the Model.
   - The Controller does not contain business logic itself; instead, it delegates to the Model to perform the necessary operations.

3. **View**:
   - The **View** is responsible for displaying data to the user.
   - It should not contain business logic but rather focus on rendering the data provided by the Controller.
   - Views are typically templates or UI components that present information to the user.

Remember these key points:

- **Separation of Concerns**: The MVC pattern aims to separate different concerns (data, presentation, and control) to improve maintainability and flexibility.
- **Business Rules vs. Business Logic**:
  - **Business rules** define constraints, policies, and guidelines specific to your domain (e.g., "Customers must have a valid email address").
  - **Business logic** refers to the actual implementation of operations (e.g., calculating discounts, updating inventory).
  - While business rules can be part of the Model, business logic (implementation details) should reside there.

Example (E-commerce Application):

- **Model**:
  - Contains methods for processing orders, calculating prices, managing inventory, and interacting with the database.
  - Validates data (e.g., ensuring valid email addresses, checking stock availability).
  - Implements business logic related to the application's core functionality.

- **Controller**:
  - Receives requests (e.g., "Place an order," "Update cart") from the user.
  - Invokes the appropriate Model methods (e.g., `placeOrder`, `updateCart`).
  - Orchestrates the interaction between the Model and the View.

- **View**:
  - Renders order confirmation pages, product listings, and shopping cart views.
  - Displays data provided by the Controller (e.g., order details, product names).

By following this structure, you achieve a clear separation of concerns, making your code more modular and maintainable. üöÄ¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥
